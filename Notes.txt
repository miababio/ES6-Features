                                    NOTES
                                    -----
                                    
Getting Setup
    - ES6 also known as ES2015
    - Babel
        - Module that let's us convert our ES6 code into compatible code for Node/browsers (ES5?)
        - Global install (latest)
        - NOTE: Because we have a higher version of Node (7.4.0), it already comes built-in with ES6 features, meaning we won't need babel
            - Still follow along anyways though
    
Project Setup
    - Right now naming convention has been standard (ES1, 2, 3, etc.)
    - Also called ECMAScript
    - New way of naming ECMAScript is by year, which is why ES6 is a.k.a ES2015, and so on
    - babel-presets (deprecated, should use babel-presets-env)
    - Defaults
        - One thing we can do now is set a default value for an argument
        - When a function is called and a parameter isn't passed in, you can give the argument a default value in the called function
            - Just like C++, VB, etc. (bout time!)
      
        - Ex: function sayHello(name = "World") {
                 console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
              }
              sayHello();

        - If you had an earlier version of Node ( <5 ) then you couldn't run this in the terminal normally; It would crash
            - You would be trying to use an ES6 feature that wasn't built into Node back then
            - To fix, use Babel to run the code instead of node, like so:
                - babel-node .\features\default.js --presets es2015 
            - Works with default Objects as well
                
                - Ex: function greetUser (user = {name: "Anonymous"}) {
                          console.log("Hello " + user.name + "!");
                      }
  
                      greetUser();                  // Displays 'Hello Anonymous!'
                      greetUser({name: "John"});    // Displays 'Hello John!'

            - To run the babel-node command easier, we can create a config file to do it for us to remove the presets part at least
                - .babelrc
                    - Inside, set the presets to ["es2015"]
                    - NOTE: This is still the deprecated way; Look online on Babel site for new configuration
                - Now in the Terminal we can just type -> babel-node .\features\default.js and it works the same way as before

Nodemon
    - Nodemon = "Node Monitoring" (who knew?)
    - Let's you automatically rerun files once you save a change
    - Easiest way to start something is "nodemon <file you want>"
    - Nodemon with Babel
        - nodemon --exec babel-node ./features/default.js
        - This will automatically run your file and through babel as well!
    - You don't have to run Nodemon on a single file, you can use it on projects as well!

Template Strings
    - console.log("Hello " + name + "!");
        - Old way -> Needed to concatenate strings to show a variable name, etc.
    - ES6 way -> Template Strings
        - Represented by the back tick (`)
        - We use the '${}' to put Javascript expressions in it
        - Now, the same line would look like -> console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
    - Again, you can use template strings for any Javascript expressions
        - console.log(`1 + 6 = ${1 + 6}`); // Displays 1 + 6 = 7
    - You can also print out newlines and spaces
        - Ex: console.log(`Hey,

              This kind of looks like an email!

              - Mike
              `);

Const
    - Short for constant
    - A const value can't be changed
        - Ex: const PORT = 3000;
              PORT = 3001; // Throws Error
    - Like other languages, you can't have multiple declarations of the same variable name either; It also throws an Error
        - Ex: const PORT = 3000;
              var PORT = 3001; // Throws Error
    - You don't have to use numbers for const-you can use objects as well!
        - NOTE: Although an Object itself will be constant when declared, an object's attributes are NOT constant, and can STILL BE MODIFIED if you wish
            - See Example 1
                - So a reminder, you can't change the variable, but you CAN change an objects' properties

Let
    - Defines a variable at the block level (if statements, for-loops, etc.)
    - Without Let
        - Ex: var x = 0;

            if(true) {
                var x = 12;
                console.log(x); // Displays 12
            }
    
            console.log(x);     // Displays 12

            - This is to be expected. We make 'x' in the beginning, and then since 'x' is already defined when we try to declare
              it in the if statement, x now becomes 12 everywhere

    - With Let
        - Ex: var x = 0;

            if(true) {
                let x = 12;
                console.log(x); // Displays 12
            }
    
            console.log(x);     // Displays 0

            - This is the power of let. The 'x' variable declared by let is only visible/known within the if statement.
              That's why the outer 'x' still remains - when we get out of the if block

    - var variables in a function are known/available everywhere, regardless of where it's made
    - If you use 'let' on the Global level, there is no block/scope level, so it acts the same way as var-you can access that variable anywhere
        - It's only really effective at the block level
    - Let with a For-Loop
        - See Example 2
    - Let with a function
        - See Example 3
            - Note: Even though let is declared in the genCallback block, INNER function still have access to that variable; anything OUTSIDE the outer
              block does NOT
                - In this case, 'var' would've done the same thing, so in this case, they are both fine

Rest & Spread Operators
    - Rest/Spread deal with using arrays mostly
    - Here we have a basic add function
        - function add(a, b) {
             return a + b;
          }
    - Right now, there's nothing special about it
    - Spread let's us "spread out" an array's contents, so we can pass in our two arguments using one array
        - See Example 4
            - add(...numbers)
                - The format for spread is an ellipses, followed by either an array after the dots (...[]), or a variable name instead (...numbers)
                - This means to take the contents of numbers, and apply them to the add function
        - We can also use the spread operator when creating an array

            - Ex: var groupA = [33, 99];
                  var groupB = [11];
                  var unified = [0, ...groupA, ...groupB, 100];  
                  console.log(unified); // Displays [ 0, 33, 99, 11, 100 ]

        - We can use Array methods and pass in the spread operator as well
            - Ex: unified.push(...[55, 33]); // Now whole array displays [ 0, 33, 99, 11, 100, 55, 33 ]

    - Rest (rest params) are used inside of your function definition
        - See Example 5 
            - We are able to pass in all of those names separately, (instead of passing an array) because of rest params
            - Using the "...names" parameter, we're able to pass in all of our arguments as an array
        - You can have other arguments before the array
            - Ex: function greetUsers(group, ...names) {...}
                - This means that the first argument will be set to 'group', and then every subsequent argument will be added to the names array
    - Remember, Rest and Spread dont have to work for just numbers; They can be used for Strings, Objects, etc. as well
        - As long as you pass/use an array, the contents of the array can be whatever you want

Arrow Functions
    - var people = ['Andrew', 'Mike', 'John', 'Jen'];

      people.forEach(function(name) {
          console.log(name);
      });

    - In cases like above, Arrow functions let us replace anonymous functions
        - Ex: people.forEach((name) => console.log(name));
            - For arrow functions, you don't need the word 'function' anymore, just te parameters, followed by the '=>' arrow, and then you either have a block of statements, or just one line
                - Since all we did was console.log this time, we could put it on one line
        - Both functions are identical
    - Another thing about arrow functions is that you can make really short functions, if they are one-liners
        - See Example 6
            - var add = (a, b) => a + b;
                - When you have a one line statement, and don't have the curly braces around it, Javascript will automatically make that a return statement
                    - This is considered an Implicit return
                    - An Explicit return would look like this -> var add = (a, b) => { return a + b; }
                        - This one is used for multi-line stuff usually, vs. a one-liner
    - Another thing about arrow functions is that when you use them, the 'this' keyword doesn't lose it's binding
        - var person = {
              name: 'Mike',
              likes: ['Movies', 'Programming', 'Running'],
              generateGreeter: function() {
                  return function() {
                      console.log(this.name);
                  }
              }
          }

            - As this is right now, this will fail!
                - "this.name" in the anonymous function does NOT refer to our name property we have made above
                - The workaround at the time was to create another variable, set it to 'this', and then use that other variable to get the name
                    - Ex: var that = this;
                          return function() {
                              console.log(that.name);
                          }
                          ...
                          person.generateGreeter()(); // Displays Mike

                    - New way with arrow functions -> See Example 7
                        - Inside arrow functions, you now have access to the same 'this' binding of the containing function
    - Also, just a quick note:
        - printLikes: function() {
              return () => {
                  this.likes.forEach((like) => console.log(`${this.name} likes ${like}`));
              }
          } 

          - Trying to have "printLikes: () => {...}" DOES NOT WORK
            - Can't do a double arrow like that I guess (will look into later)

For...of
    - A new way to iterate over elements in an array
    - See Example 8
        - Format -> for(<variable_name> of <array you want to loop over>) {...}
    - Pretty straightforward

Maps
    - Let's us create key/value pairs, and also comes with other utilities that might be preferred to be used over Objects

    - var myMap = new Map();
        - Creates an empty map

    - myMap.set('name', 'Mike');
        - 'set' adds a key/value pair to the map
            - Similar to HashMap.put() in Java

    - myMap.get('name')
        - Gets the value from the map, based on the key

    - myMap.has('age')
        - 'has' goes through the map and checks to see if we have this key in it. If we do, it returns true. If not, it returns false

    - myMap.delete('name');
        - Removes a key/value from the map, based on the key

    - myMap.clear();
        - Removes everything from the map

    - myMap.size
        - Returns the size of the map

    - So why would we use this over an Object?
        - For one, Map has various utilities out of the box, compared to an Object (get, set, clear, size, etc.)
        - When you create an Object, the keys HAVE to be strings; Map keys can be ANYTHING (Objects, booleans, numbers, etc.)
            - See Example 9
    - Sometimes, if we have multiple stuff in our map, we want to do something with it, such as printing everything in it all at once
    - We can do so in a couple ways:
        - 1. Use the 'spread' operation

            - Ex: var myMap = new Map();
                  myMap.set(1, 'Mike');
                  myMap.set(2, 'Jack');
                  myMap.set(3, 'Ben');
                  console.log([...myMap]); // Displays [ [ 1, 'Mike' ], [ 2, 'Jack' ], [ 3, 'Ben' ] ]

                - You get an array of arrays; In other words, you get an array with each key/value pair as an array
                - Now you could do a forEach and loop over everything and use it that way

        - 2. Use the keys() and values() methods
            - Ex: console.log(myMap.keys());   // Displays -> MapIterator { 1, 2, 3 }
            - Ex: console.log(myMap.values()); // Displays -> MapIterator { 'Mike', 'Jack', 'Ben' }

Sets
    - Has built-in similar methods to Map
    - Maps we store key, value pairs. With Sets however, we just store the value
        - It's similar to an array
        - The difference between sets and arrays (other than the methods) is that Sets CANNOT have the same value twice
            - In other words, sets only let you store unique values

    - var chatRooms = new Set();
        - Creates an empty Set

    - chatRooms.add('Runners');
        - Adds "Runners" to the set. If you tried adding it again, it wouldn't work

    - chatRooms.size;
        - Returns the current size of the Set

    - chatRooms.has('Runners')
        - Has checks to see if a value is in the set. Returns true/false

    - chatRooms.delete('Bikers');
        - Removes a single element from the set

    - chatRooms.clear();
        - Removes ALL elements in the set (like a reset)

    - You can convert your set to other data types, just like Maps
        - To an array
            - console.log([...chatRooms]); -> Returns [ 'Runners', 'Bikers' ]
            - Like Maps, you can add any value you want to the Set and it'll print all of it
                - chatRooms.add({name: 'Mike'});
                console.log([...chatRooms]); -> Returns [ 'Runners', 'Bikers', { name: 'Mike' } ]
            - If you wanted to iterate over the SEt, you could do the spread like above, then call forEach on the array from there
                - With Sets, you can also just call forEach directly on it, w/o having to do any spreads or anything like that
                    - Ex: chatRooms.forEach(function(chatRoom) {
                              console.log(`Found chat room: ${chatRoom}`);
                          }); 

New Object Features
    - 



                                  Examples
                                  --------
                            
Example 1 - Const with Objects
---------
const CONFIG = {
    PORT: 3000
};

console.log(CONFIG); // Displays { PORT: 3000 }
CONFIG.PORT = 3001;
console.log(CONFIG); // Displays { PORT: 3001 }


Example 2 - Var vs Let -> For-Loop
---------

With var
--------
for(var i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    console.log(`For loop: i = ${i}`);
    // Displays
        // For loop: i = 0
        // For loop: i = 1
        // For loop: i = 2
}

console.log(i); // Displays 3

With let
--------
for(let i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    console.log(`For loop: i = ${i}`);
    // Displays
        // For loop: i = 0
        // For loop: i = 1
        // For loop: i = 2
}

console.log(i); // Program crashes; 'i' doesn't exist outside the scope!


Example 3 - Let with Functions
---------
function genCallback() {
    let name = "Michael"
    return function() {
        console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
    }
}

genCallback()(); // Displays 'Hello Michael'


Example 4 - Spread Example
---------
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

var numbers = [4, 22];

console.log(add(1, 4));            // Displays 5
console.log(add(...numbers));      // Displays 26


Example 5 - Rest Example
---------
function greetUsers(...names) {
    names.forEach(function(name) {
        console.log('Hello ' + name);
    });
}

greetUsers('Andrew', 'Mike', 'Jen'); // Displays "Hello Andrew", "Hello Mike", "Hello Jen" on separate lines


Example 6 - One-Liner Arrow Function
---------
// Original function definition
/* function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
} */

// Arrow Function
var add = (a, b) => a + b;

console.log(add(3, 9));


Example 7 - "This" binding
---------
var person = {
    name: 'Mike',
    likes: ['Movies', 'Programming', 'Running'],
    generateGreeter: function() {
        return () => {
            console.log(this.name);
        }
    }
};

person.generateGreeter()(); // Displays Mike


Example 8 - For...of
---------
var locations = [];
locations.push({
    name: 'Madison',
    weather: 75
});

locations.push({
    name: 'Sun Prairie',
    weather: 73
});

for(let location of locations) {
    console.log(`It's ${location.weather} in ${location.name}`);    // Displays "It's 75 in Madison" and "It's 73 in Sun Prairie" on separate lines
}


Example 9 - Maps: Using other key types
---------
var user = {name: 'Mike'};
myMap.set(user, 'Madison');
console.log(myMap.get(user)); // Displays 'Madison'


Example 10 -
